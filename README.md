üåç Level Up Your Data Visualization Skills with R!

Inspired by Prof. Paul Christiansen's tutorial, I created my own map in R using ggplot2 to visualize COVID-19 vaccination rates across countries in Europe during 2020. üìä This tutorial helped me bring data to life with color-coded maps and customization options, making it easy to communicate insights effectively. Adding my own touches, including logos and personalized color schemes, has taken my data storytelling to the next level!
